# Clubear

Clubear is a mobile application that allows users to book tables, pre-order drinks, and select seating positions in nightclubs and bars. The app is built with React Native and TypeScript, and uses Firebase for authentication and data storage, Redux for state management, and AI-generated images for design elements.


## Features
- User authentication with Firebase
- Guest mode for quick access to app features
- Table search and booking
- Drink pre-ordering
- Seating position selection
- AI-generated images for design elements
- Admin panel for club owners
- Analytics on customer behavior

## Setup

To run the app locally, you'll need to have Node.js and the Expo CLI installed. You can then clone the app's repository from GitHub and run "npm install" to install the required dependencies. You'll also need to create a Firebase project and add your own API keys to the app's configuration files.

Once you've set everything up, you can run the app with "expo start" and view it on your local device or emulator.
